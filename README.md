# NeuralStyleTransfer
A Variational autoencoder based Style transfer 


A Variational Auto Encoder made to transfer style of one image onto another as proposed by the Paper <\br>
used A VGG16 network to encode images <\br>
content loss is taken only for last VGG layer <\br>
Style loss is used for layers [3,8,15,22] <\br>
